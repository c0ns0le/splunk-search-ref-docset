# What's this
This is a docset for Splunk Search Reference. Hopefully this will be helpful for Mac users who also use dash and Alfred.

# What's dash
Dash (http://kapeli.com/dash) is a great tool to check any documentations: javadoc, Objective C docset, nodejs and others.

If you purchase the powpack of Alfrd, you can use keyboard to quickly search any document. With this SPL docset, you can quickly figure out which splunk commands you need, even you cannot fully spell it
# How to use
After you install Dash, simply clone or download this project, and open the Dash preference, add the spl.docset. Then you can use spl:cmdName to search any command.
